Visualizing OLSRD topography using d3 force-directed graphs.
============================================================

takes a topo dump from olsrd (using textinfo /topo) with little
reformatting (see the sample). And visualizes it.

What you need to do your own
----------------------------

* Clone the github repo
* Have OLSRD with textinfo running on your network
* change the get-topo.sh file to reflect the IP of your OLSRd textinfo node
* Done!
